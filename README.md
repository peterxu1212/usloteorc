for paper "Utilizing Spatial Locality to Optimize Temporal Efficiency in OLSR Route Calculations"

find the detail of the paper in https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6726324

Published in: 2013 IEEE 9th International Conference on Mobile Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks



To implement the proposed algorithm in the paper, 
the code in qualnet 5.0 (https://www.scalable-networks.com/qualnet-network-simulation), 
with the names of routing_olsr-inria.h and routing_olsr-inria.cpp, 
located in .\qualnet\5.0\libraries\wireless\src\
should be modifed:

usloteorc/code/original/  the codes before modification
usloteorc/code/modified/  the codes after modification

the detailed modification, or the implementation of the proposed new algorithm, can be studied by comparing these two folders
